the major changes are as follows: 
---> the inclusion of new skills (computers, etiquette, mechanics, piloting, science)
---> the removal of obsolete skills (animal handling, nature, religion, sleight of hand, performance)
---> the implementation of a new caster type, "half+", with a different spell-slot progression than typical full casters (i.e. the Psion)
---> ---> the half+ caster type is called half1 when necessary in the code itself, but that's a dumb name to display to users XP
---> addition of "barrier hp" section below temporary hit points
---> adjustments to textbox names to better match the layout of the character sheet for Spaceships and Starwyrms
---> removal of all "by roll20" references to make it comply with the submission policies
---> Tweaked the NPC sheet to support Ship details a little more organically

Stuff to implement
---> who knows whats next!
